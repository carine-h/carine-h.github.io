# Air Wars: The Fight for Media??
Every presidential election, *millions* of dollars are spent on campaign ads, whether that be on TV, the radio, social media, or elsewhere. Campaigns use all of these forms of media to meet voters where they're at and persuade them from the comfort of their own homes or on their own social media feeds to 1) vote and 2) vote for their candidate.

Today I'll be taking a general look at the use of ads over different elections, their purpose, their location, and the money spent on them. I ask the following questions: 
  1. How much do elections spend on ads? (gen graph of spent by state)
  2. Where do ads go? (states AND swing states)
  3. What do ads do? (purpose)
  4. How does incumbency impact the "Air War"? 
  5. What's the latest with 2020? 
  6. What does this all mean? Does it matter? 
  
  It's important to note that data on the current ad spending is limited so I'll be using restrospective analysis to look at the general properties of the Air War.
