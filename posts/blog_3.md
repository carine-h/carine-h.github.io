# Timing is Everything: Polls and Election Outcomes  
If you've watched the news, listened to a podcast, opened a snapchat, scrolled throughout Instagram, or perused your Facebook feed in the past year, chances are you've been bombarded with poll numbers. "Biden is up X points!" "Trump is leading in this week's polls!" 

Phrases like these seem so determinant: if a poll says it, it must be true. In reality, however, elections are decided by many factors and polls can't be the only factor in predicting the election. If you've been following along with my other posts, fundamental factors like economic performance or incumbency often decide elections before they even occur. [READING?] Therefore, polls, it seems, could be utterly redundant. Can't you just take a look at GDP? It turns out it's more complicated than that: polls can be useful in measuring the present feeling among voters and often reflect fluctuations in short-term approval of candidates, spiking and falling for scandals, breaking news, and convetion excitement. These short-term reflections are not totally useful in predicting the end of an election - they seldom endure. We voters are ficle creatures. Moreover, though polls reflect momentary reactions to notable events, they also lack spikes and falls for other important events. 

So why, then, am I writing this blog post? It turns out that polls, overall, can still be important predictors of an outcome. But take them with a grain of salt. When looking at a poll here are some key factors to consider: 
- what's the sample size?
- what question was asked?
- is the poll national or state-based?
- how closely was the poll taken to the election? *(we'll explore this question in detail today)*

The answer to the questions determine the **bias** of the poll. Bias is often the reason a singular poll is not the most reliable. Following [guy's] logic, averaging as many polls as possible helps better predict an election outcome and has in past elections. Another possible remedy to poll bias is **timing.** With the following models, I'll establish the following about the timing of a poll in its relation to predicting an election: 
- the closer a poll is to an election, the more certainty it has 
- the closer a poll is to an election, the more it correlates with the election outcome

#### The Moral of the Story 
The moral of the story is, don't get worked up about polls early on. In fact, maybe don't pay attention to them at all...maybe not until October, that is!
