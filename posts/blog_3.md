# The Power of Polls 
If you've watched the news, listened to a podcast, opened a snapchat, scrolled throughout Instagram, or perused your Facebook feed in the past year, chances are you've been bombarded with poll numbers. "Biden is up X points!" "Trump is leading in this week's polls!" 

Phrases like these seem so determinant: if a poll says it, it must be true. In reality, however, elections are decided by many factors and polls can't be the only factor in predicting the election. If you've been following along with my other posts, fundamental factors like economic performance or incumbency often decide elections before they even occur. [READING?] Therefore, polls, it seems, could be utterly redundant. Can't you just take a look at GDP? It turns out it's more complicated than that: polls can be useful in measuring the present feeling among voters and often reflect fluctuations in short-term approval of candidates, spiking and falling for scandals, breaking news, and convetion excitement. These short-term reflections are not totally useful in predicting the end of an election - they seldom endure. We voters are ficle creatures. Moreover, though polls reflect momentary reactions to notable events, they also lack spikes and falls for other important events. 

So why, then, am I writing this blog post? It turns out that polls, overall, can still be important predictors of an outcome. But take them with a grain of salt. When looking at a poll here are some key factors to consider: 
- what's the sample size?
- what question was asked?
- is the poll national or state-based?
- how closely was the poll taken to the election? **(we'll explore this question in detail today)**
